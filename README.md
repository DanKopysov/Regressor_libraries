In this script there are all of the steps I have made to prepare the solution. The code is splited into several sections:
- Data Import and preparation
- Variables transformation
- Division into subsets and preparation for regression
- OLS
- Ridge
- Lasso
- Tree
- Random forest  
The most effective in terms of MAE measure is the Random Forest model. So, it would be the main algorithm for further work.
